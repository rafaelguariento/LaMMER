We are interested in undeerstand how resistance emerge and proliferate in populations. Such resistance may manifest in the form of defensive strategies/traits that prey may have against predators or traits in pests or patogens that confer resistance to xenobiotics. *Our approach to such issues are mainly through theoretical methods, such as mathematical models and computer simulations.*
