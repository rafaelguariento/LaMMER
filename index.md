The Lab. of Mathematical Modeling on the Evolution of Resistance (**LaMMER**) is based at the [**Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil**](http://ufms.br)

We are interested in understanding how resistance emerge and proliferate in populations. Such resistance may manifest in the form of defensive strategies/traits that prey may have against predators or traits in pests or patogens that confer resistance to xenobiotics. *Our approach to such issues is mainly through theoretical methods, such as **mathematical models** and **computer simulations**.*

Some computational resources from our research can be foud [here](https://github.com/rafaelguariento/).

### Main research areas

#### Defensive mechanisms prey would evolve to get away from predators 

How prey individuals assess their environments and respond to varying conditions is a crutial issue in Ecology. We investigate how prey respond to predators and how predation works as a selective force driving the prevalence of defended phenotypes in prey populations. We often look at the ecological consequences, from the individual to the ecosystem, emerging from prey responses to predators.  


#### Development of resistance to pesticides 

The evolution of the resistence to pesticides is a major threat to food security. We are investigating the drivers of pesticide resistance development and proliferation in pest populations using mathematical models. We also investigate how evolutionary- and ecologically-informed management strategies can help mitigate the development of pesticide resistance.
