The Lab. of Mathematical Modeling on the Evolution of Resistance (**LaMMER**) is based in the [**Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil**](http://ufms.br)

We are interested in understand how resistance emerge and proliferate in populations. Such resistance may manifest in the form of defensive strategies/traits that prey may have against predators or traits in pests or patogens that confer resistance to xenobiotics. *Our approach to such issues are mainly through theoretical methods, such as **mathematical models** and **computer simulations**.*

### Main research areas

#### Defensive mechanisms prey would evolve to get away from predators 

How prey individuals assess their environments and respond to varying conditions is a crutial issue in Ecology. We investigate 


#### Developmnet of resistance to pesticides

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rafaelguariento/LaMMER/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
